<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html">Joel on Software - The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing</a><p />This is such an amazing post. The topic being the same as my previous post on this blog <a href="http://2002_11_17_jinga_archive.html/#84762657">Interviews - Fact and Opinion</a>. What I call skill (probably incorrectly), is what he calls aptitude; and what I call specialized knowledge is what he calls skill. Otherwise, Joel puts it far more eloquently that I ever could.<p />There one thing that I don't agree with him though:<br />- The 5 lines-of-code limit. I would like to see the programmer doing proper error checking and want to see how he organizes his program.<p />I should start using some of the stuff he says in my interviews too. Thanks Joel!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-2918399058130066941?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
