This is really good stuff. ACM has started giving access to complete books published by some really good publishers (Wiley, MIT Press, Cambridge to name a few).<p />I have added a couple of neat books to my bookshelf -<br />The Art of Software Architecture - Stephen T Albin<br />Writing Secure Code<br />The Art of Deception - Kevin Mitnick.<p />Some good titles. My ACM membership fees have paid themselves many times over already!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-7898365055737314135?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
