I made the mistake of installing AOL on my machine (a grave sin I agree). The damn thing will not give any options for installation. A sampling of the crap it put on my machine<br />- AOL connectivity service (Yeah, right! Give me a phone number man)<br />- AOL photo screen saver<br />- AOL spyware protection<br />and as I was installing my wireless router, it asks me if it should go screw my router as well.<p />SBC Yahoo DSL is no better. They have some self support tool and client foundation s***.<p />ISPs should stop creating nonsense software and stick to providing internet service.<p />Gawwwwd. Back to uninstalling crap now......<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-2726099744544269425?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
