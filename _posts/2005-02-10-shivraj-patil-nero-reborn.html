The home minister of India fiddles when the country burns. Mr. Patil has the uncanny ability of saying the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time. A random news search sample below -<p /><b><i>The Hindu, Aug 20, 2004 - Made during the height of the protests against AFSPA in Manipur</i></b><p /><i>The Union Home Minister, Shivraj Patil, said the Centre would take "appropriate action" if the situation did not improve in Manipur despite the State Government's efforts and the partial lifting of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from Imphal city.<p />Without elaborating on the "appropriate action" and remaining non-committal on imposing President's rule in the State, Mr. Patil said: "There are many other options. What is appropriate action, you can read in the Constitution. The Constitution provides several options. Some different approach can be adopted. The State Government is trying; they are on the field and know more. We will not do anything which will embarrass the State Government at this moment."</i><p /><b><i>rediff.com, Feb 10, 2005 - Made during midst of protests by Sikhs to make the Nanavati commission findings on 1984 anti-Sikh riots public</i></b><p /><i><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/feb/10sikh.htm">Make Nanavati report public: Sikh groups</a><p />"There is a procedure which has to be followed when the inquiries are constituted, when the reports are submitted and when the reports are examined by the government," Patil said.</i><p />Why does India need to tolerate such an incompetent home minister?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-4199413201448907522?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
