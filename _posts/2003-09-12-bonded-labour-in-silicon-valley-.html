<a href="http://in.rediff.com/news/2003/sep/12spec.htm">Bonded to the loom</a><br />There are many arguments to child labour in India. One valid reason is that the families are so economically backward that the kids must work to feed themselves.<br />But when parents start sending their kids out into bonded labour, you know things are really bad. Is it shunning responsibility as parents? Or is that just a middle class measure that we have? Can we see this problem in the clear black and white?<br />If anything, this story shows how one step forward (World Bank loans for sericulture) may mean 2 steps back.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-9153425456275085327?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
