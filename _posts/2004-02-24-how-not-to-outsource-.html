For the last 2 months, I have been involved with this completely weird outsourcing assignment. As a product company we are outsourcing work on one of our core products to another company. In itself, not such a bad idea. <p />But choosing the outsourcing partner.. now thats another story. To cut a long story short, we made a mistake (to put it lightly) in going with the company now. Oh, of course, the project has a set deadline which cannot move.. And Oh, of course, the project has a tight budget which cannot be exceeded. And uh oh, no due diligence was done while picking this outsourcing partner.<p />Guess what! I am the unfortunate soul who is "managing risks" on this project. To put it bluntly, I am in a lot of shit. <p />Watch this space for more tamasha!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/24624893-2302262005307326982?l=www.financial-technology.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
